    about: " 'Moscow Mule' is the name given to the song that opens the album A Summer Without You, and which also serves as the first single from the record project, as it is released along with its official video. The song takes its name from the homonymous cocktail, which in Spanish would be translated as 'Moscow mule' -which despite referring to the Russian city, is of American origin. The moscow mule is a preparation that contains vodka, lemon juice, ginger beer and a whole lemon, and is consumed in a cup made of copper, which gives it its characteristic appearance. This cocktail is easily associated with hot seasons, being considered 'the most refreshing summer'.",

    However, El Conejo also seeks to give a message of motivation to his listeners through a wink made in the chorus, by changing the word 'mine' to 'yours'.",

This nostalgia evokes towards him when looking at the photos with her and thinking about moments like sex, walks together and the first times they were intimate. While the topic progresses, Benito is curious to know what will become of her and is excited about the possibility of having something together again.",

    Upon reaching the conclusion that he does not have enough money, Benito begins to reflect and criticizes the current educational system and the saturation of the labor market that affects recent graduates. These social problems, which in 2020 are present in many countries around the world, take them further, even relating them to the reasons that force some young people to decide to commit crimes out of desperation.",

    Despite being aware of all this, Bad Bunny confesses to having an uncontrollable addiction for her, making it impossible for him to get away from her, so he falls into something similar to the vicious circle of consumption that traps drug addicts.
    The instrumental is pretty much inspired by a punk trap, with a fast rhythm that intensifies as the seconds go by.

    about: "Rumba has always been one of Yankee's signature genres, bringing him some of his biggest hits like 'Ella Me Levant√≥'. In 'LEGENDADDY', on his eighth and last studio album by Daddy Yankee, he pays homage to a song by Tr√©bol Clan, called 'B√°ilame'

    Also bringing back Eliel, producer of songs like 'Lo Que Pas√≥, Pas√≥' and returning to love lyrics, in which Yankee invites this woman to dance with him to forget the sorrows.",

    Their first song together was 'Vuelve' in 2017, marking the beginning of Bad Bunny's career. Then for Bad Bunny's second album they joined in 'La Santa' in 2020. Finally they meet on this song to say goodbye to Daddy Yankee's career before his retirement.",

    about: "'BOMB√ìN' is the sixteenth song from LEGENDADDY, Daddy Yankee's eighth studio album, together with rappers El Alfa 'El Jefe', from the Dominican Republic, and Lil Jon, from the United States.

    The song belongs to the 'Dembow' genre, very characteristic of El Alfa, but with the addition of Lil Jon, who, although he had already participated in the Gasolina remix years ago, was never very close to the genre.

    The lyrics are nothing to write home about, they are simply Yankee, El Alfa and Jon singing and rapping about a woman's buttocks that seem to be perfect, a 'bonbon'.

    The song had a music video released at the same time as the album, on March 24, 2022.",

    In the 'Nibiru' video, Ozuna is swimming in the water when suddenly the sirens help him to the top. He comes out of the water into a huge stone cave. He examines his surroundings and is surrounded by rocks, he begins to see alien figures coming out of the cave walls. Ozuna enters one of the caves while these figures dance around him following him on his journey. In an epic reveal, he reaches the end of the cave corridor when a massive black hole appears and without warning, he is pulled in by a gravitational pull.",

    A violent storm of wind, dust and smoke hits a dystopian city. We find Ozuna looking out the window at the city as the world explodes below. Huge dust storms reach their home planet. Ozuna turns around and discovers that his wife's face and hair have turned into galaxies. The stars that make up his wife's body begin to explode one by one until she completely disappears. He knows where he has to go. Ozuna begins his journey through the streets and finds his space bike. As he travels, the city begins to explode, destroyed by the storm and lightning. When the light comes, it clears up and he finds a spaceship, Ozuna gets on it and begins his journey, his journey to Nibiru (a fictional place in space).

    The story continues in 'Hasta Que Salga El Sol', chapter two of this mini-series.",

    'vaya con dios' is a Spanish phrase meant as farewell. It literally translates to 'go with God'. It's normally used in religious or in very dramatic contexts such as when someone says goodbye to someone who is about to go on a long, dangerous journey. That's why she says 'No s√© si lo volver√© a ver' which means 'I don't know if I'll ever see you again'

    An English equivalent may be ‚Äúgodspeed‚Äù or 'may God be with you'",
